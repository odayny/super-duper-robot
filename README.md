Problems from HackerRank/Leetcode/etc... I decided to keep.

I'm not a guru in solving such problems and doing it whe have time and passion for that, and improving my theoretical knowledge at the same time.

Backing it up just in case...

So
![It ain't much, but it's honest work.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/021/work.jpg)


Anyways feel free to reach me if you have question.

PS: some files were added here by using GitHub web editor by copying code from my solutions. So don't expect that they're compilable without modifications (adding imports or renaming)

PS2: I don't care about commit messages much in this repo
